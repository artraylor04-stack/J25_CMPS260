# Quiz 1 - 24-hour day in my life

#Purpose of the app
It is to calculate how I spend my time and how much of it I spend productively doing things. For example, it shows things like sleep, homework, fun, and classes. I added the information to see how my schedule is, and I learned that I spent more time on certain things, which is what I wanted the code to do.

#Execution
My code can be run using Visual Studio. The code submitted shows the times that I input, but you can change them.
