#Coffee Shop Order Calculator

#Purpose of the app 
It is a program that simulates a point‑of‑sale calculator for a local coffee shop. It allows the user to enter the number of small, medium, and large coffees ordered, along with a tax rate. It then calculates: subtotal, tax amount, and total amount due.

#Execution 
My code can be run using Visual Studio. Using Visual Studio or VS Code, simply build and run the project.
